***WARNING:*** this is a modified version of the spip_webpage_from_hal plugin, developped by Boris Morel, from Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/Saga-UGA/spip_webpage_from_hal). This version was modified for aesthetics and more flexibility (such as for the thumbnails). ***Since they don't provide any LICENSE.txt for the moment it's difficult to know in which conditions we are allowed to used this software or not. Therefore, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.*** (I've openned an issue on their GitHub repository to ask them to add a LICENSE.txt file).
